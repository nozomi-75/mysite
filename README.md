# Pico
This repository hosts my simple personal website and some projects that I have worked on. Similarly, it presents Pico — a beginner-friendly, dead-simple, resposive site layout, written purely in HTML and CSS.

## Simple Debian Wiki
It is the roots of Pico, when I was working on a simplified Debian Wiki for beginners. It includes a brief introduction on The Debian Project and the community along with its philosophy and moral agenda. It also includes a concise setup guide for Debian GNU/Linux systems.

## DildOS
It is a pet project of mine that started when Scented Orange shared his distribution with us in the Debian Discord server. I wanted to make it a simple, responsive, and welcoming website that would able to give users a sneak peek of the system. It shares a similar layout with my personal website and the debwiki, albeit minor differences in the stylesheet in order to accomodate a side-by-side image and text container, and evoke an enthusiastic atmosphere towards potential users. The favicon used for this project can be found [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Orange_slice.svg).

## FAQ

1. Why are they in one repository altogether?

> I'm lazy managing different, separate repositories. I also want my webdev pet projects arranged in this repository altogether, like a simple portfolio!

2. Why make Pico?

> Webdev is also a form of art in itself. Art is a form of expression. I wanted to express my feelings through Pico — how I want things to be simple and neat, how I want the elements to be consistent, how I want the site to behave similarly regardless of the browser — amidst all my discontentment in current practices. Not that my practices are any better, but I hope that it will grow up to be as I take up more projects.

3. Why are their stylesheets separate, despite having the similar layout.

> The projects that I've worked so far have indeed a similar layout. However, I find that I'm bound to specify varying styles for each and every project someday, depending on the message or emotions that I want to convey to its audience. With this, I find it more neat and manageable to separate them, so I won't get confused.
