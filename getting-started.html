		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 14pt; margin-bottom: 40px;">Meet Debian project, a community of volunteers around the world working together on the Debian operating system, with <strong>Free and Open Source Software</strong> at its very heart. Debian is a free Linux distribution with thousands of applications to meet users' needs.</p>
		<h2>Philosophy and Social Contract</h2>
		<p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 14pt;">The core philosophy of Debian is focused on giving people freedomâ€”to create an operating system that can be free to everybody. To do it, requires the integrated effort of people working together with this same aspiration. Debian clearly underlines software freedom with respect to the users and the free software community. The Debian Social Contract makes this commitment written, and it guarantees that both the system and all its elements are in compliance with the free software guidelines. It ensures that there is support available for the users of free software and non-free software but, at the same time, totally avoids dependence on any non-free component.</p>
