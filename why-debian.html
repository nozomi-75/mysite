		<h2>Secure and Reliable</h2>
		
		<p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 14pt; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 40px;">Debian is a Linux-based operating system that is free and community-driven. It has a development model targeted at stability and reliability while taking care of security by means of strict testing and update procedures. These are what have built the reputation of Debian as safe and reliable.</p>
		
		<h2>Easy and Customizable</h2>
		
		<p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 14pt; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 40px;">With its easy package management system, APT, and community resources, Debian is very easy to use right from installation, even for people who have never used Linux. At the same time, it allows a great deal of customization to fit all kinds of special requirements users might have.</p>
		
		<h2>Versatile and Performant</h2>
		
		<p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 14pt; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 40px;">Besides security, Debian has been designed to be versatile, catering to a wide variety of computing purposes. This can be proved by the fact that it can work on systems ranging from small personal computers to huge servers; therefore, it is highly scalable. Performance also remains as one of the major factors that is kept under consideration in Debian; therefore, the developers strive hard to make the system efficient in working.</p>
		
		<h2>Liberty and Community</h2>
		
		<p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size: 14pt; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 40px;">One of the underlying principles of Debian is "free software." It means that users are at liberty to use, study, modify, and share the software. Such philosophy corresponds to the values of a lot of open source communities, which serves as the reason for Debian's strong user base.</p>
